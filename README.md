# rest_template_nodejs

optional: You can use a docker config from my other repo for get up a dev environment and a database in mongo with a visual web app for the database
link for docker files, docker and docker-compose should be installed:
```https://github.com/lol955714/docker-files/tree/main/rest-server```

put the files at the same level of the root dir for the template

``` docker-compose up -d --build  ```

or if u have a mongo database installed just:

```npm install```
```npm run start```
